  As part of a Optimization Techinques course that I take at university, with a friend we developed a GUI program that allows to visualize an animation of the error curves for the gradient descent optimization technique.

  The program was developed using MATLAB. At the moment it's really ineficient since it was the first (and only) thing I ever did using MATLAB. You can find the source code for in <a href="https://github.com/MartinTello/gradient-descent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this repo</a>. I have plans to make a web based version, but I haven't had time :(
