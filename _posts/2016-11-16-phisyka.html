<p>
  This project was a development together with a physics teacher at my university. The idea was to produce a low-cost alternative for data collection hardware in physics experimentation, using Arduino an a web based solution to visualize data from the experiments.
</p>

<p>
  The prototype was for inclined plane experimetns. It consisted of two light sensors to calculate the distance between two points A and B, and a cart that slide between them. Students could connect to a local network to visualize the experiment data and solve practical excercises from there.

  We wrote a paper for the project, which was published on the Journal of Physics Teaching. You can find the publication <a href="https://revistas.unc.edu.ar/index.php/revistaEF/article/view/15619" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
