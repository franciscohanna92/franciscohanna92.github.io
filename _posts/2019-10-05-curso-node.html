  Last year (2019) I had the opportunity to give an introductory course on building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express. This was in the context of a job training plan from my city goverment.<!--more--> The idea was to give CS and IT students tools and abilities to supply the demand of jobs for local startups and IT companies.

<p>
  The course covered from basic Node.js and web concepts, all the way trough deploying the API in a Heroku. Along the way we saw REST architecture concepts, how to build a OAS3 (swagger) documentation, how to test the API using Postman.

<p>
  This was my first experience giving a tech course. There were more than 20 students attending the course and they were really enthusiastic about the topics and specially the hands-on parts. After the course finished, some of them got internships and part-time jobs, so that was great!
