  This was a very entertaining weekend project. The idea was to gather in one place the media coverage that the COVID-19 pandemic was having in different countries. <!--more-->
</p>

<p>
  Since NewsAPI covers media from many countries, cvd19.news also provides this possibility.
  For this, I created a website called cvd19.news. The site is a SPA created with Next.js that consumes news about the
  NewsAPI service pandemic, filtering only those results that contain relevant keywords.

  The site didn't have much of an impact, although it did have quite a few visits the first two weeks.
