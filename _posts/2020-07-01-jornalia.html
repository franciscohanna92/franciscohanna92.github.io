  After working on <a href="https://cvd19.news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cvd19.news</a>, where the data source came from <a href="https://newsapi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NewsAPI</a>, I decided to do some research on other news APIs available on the market.<!--more--> Seeing that the Google News API had been deprecated, and that there were not many alternatives to get data from many Argentine media, together with a friend we decided to create a news aggregator that exposes a RESTful interface.
</p>
<p>
  Combining web crawling techniques and RSS feed consumption, we developed Jornalia, a JSON API for Argentine media news. Jornalia allows searching among a large number of media, being able to filter the articles found by categories and publication dates.
  The stack is made up of an API in Express, a web crawler in Python with Scrapy and MongoDB to store all the data.
</p>
<p>
  Jornalia is still in active development phase, and we have already released the Beta version which can be found at <a href="https://jornalia.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://jornalia.net</a>. There are many plans to continue development, among which is to create a news portal that allows you to create personalized feeds and start integrating media from other countries.
