  This app is a clone of Strawpoll's voting app, widely used by streamers on Twitch. The main idea while developing it was to learn a little Angular in a practical way. To store the surveys and their responses, I used Firebase Realtime Database.<!--more-->

  It was a very fun project to do and I was really able to understand Angular's fundamentals in depth. In turn, it gave me a better understanding of how Firebase works.
